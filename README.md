# Python practice

This is a collection of small python projects I have done to practice my Python. It's a compilation of programs, put together by Piush Kumar Sharma in a nice PDF file I have stumbled upon on my LinkedIn.

Feel free to look through them!

As a data analyst, Python is one of the main languages I use to create charts and data sets for my company. Combined with Power BI, it makes for a powerful duo to create and visualise data.
