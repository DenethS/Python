#The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two
#preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. So, the sequence begins with 0 and 1, and
#the next number is obtained by adding the previous two numbers. This pattern continues
#indefinitely, generating a sequence that looks like this:
#0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on.
#Mathematically, the Fibonacci sequence can be defined using the following recurrence
#relation:
#𝐹(0) = 0 𝐹(1) = 1 𝐹(𝑛) = 𝐹(𝑛 − 1) + 𝐹(𝑛 − 2)𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑛 > 1

nterms = int(input("How many terms?"))

#First two terms
n1, n2 = 0, 1
count = 0

#Check if the number of terms is valid
if nterms <= 0:
    print("Please enter a positive integer")
#If there is only one term, return n1
elif nterms == 1:
    print("Fibonacci sequence upto", nterms, ": ")
    print(n1)
#Generate Fibonacci sequence
else:
    print("Fibonacci sequence: ")
    while count < nterms:
        print(n1)
        nth = n1+n2
        #Update values
        n1 = n2
        n2 = nth
        count += 1
